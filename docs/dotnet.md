## Local debugging for functions written in .NET

### Prerequisites:
* Function runtime should be `dotnet6`
* Function type has to be zip. Image functions are not supported.
* Has to be a SAM project. CDK might come later.
* It assumes a folder structure where the SAM template is in the root, next to the `samconfig.toml` file
* The SAM template can be in either JSON or YAML format and can be called anything with a `json`, `yml`, `yaml` or `.template` extension
* You need to have npm/node installed on your system.

### Supported IDEs
Local debugging should work in any IDE, however `samp local --debug` automates launch config for the following IDEs:
* VS Code
* JetBrains Rider
* Visual Studio

### Get started
1. Install `samp-cli`:
```bash
$ npm install -g samp-cli
```
2. cd to your .NET Lambda project root (make sure it has been deployed and that you're targeting a test environment. *Never* run this against a production environment!)
3. Run `samp local --debug` and follow the prompts. This will create/append to `launch.json` and `tasks.json` in your `.vscode` folder with the necessary launch configuration. You only need to do this once per project.
4. Run `samp local` and leave it running. (see `samp local --help` for all options)
5. Hit F5 (or start debugging via the dropdown menu)

When you're done debugging, kill the `samp local` process with Ctrl+C (âŒ˜+C on Mac) and you functions will be restored to run in the cloud again.


### Hot reloads and .NET

Hot reloads work well with NodeJS, but the native .NEt support isn't quite there yet and it's due in .NET 7
8. After every change to your function code you need to ensure that the `./.samp-out/dotnet.csproj` file is re-compiled. You can either:
  - Manually recompile using the command line `dotnet build ./samp-out/dotnet.csproj`
  - Add the `dotnet.csproj` file to your solution and recompile as part of your debug process
9. Hit F5 (or start debugging from the UI)
